# Breedify – Intelligent Cattle Breed Classification System

Breedify is a deep learning–based computer vision project designed to automatically identify cattle and classify their breeds from images.
The system uses a two-stage model pipeline to improve accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, making it suitable for real-world livestock management and agri-tech applications.

🚀 Project Overview

Breedify works in two sequential stages:

Model_A (Cattle vs Non-Cattle Detection)
Filters input images to determine whether they contain cattle or not.
**(You can download model_a.ipynb file to see the code in jupyter notebbook)**

Model_B (Cattle Breed Classification)
Once an image is confirmed as cattle, it is passed to a multi-class model that classifies the cattle into one of 35 different breeds.
**(You can download modelb.ipynb file to see the code in jupyter notebbook)
**
Both models are trained using EfficientNet (EfficientNet-B series) for high performance with optimized computational cost.

**🧠 Why Two Models?**

Using a two-model pipeline offers several advantages:

1.Prevents non-cattle images from entering the breed classifier
2. Improves overall accuracy
3.Faster and more efficient inference

🔄 Easier future expansion (adding new breeds or animal types)
